# Prime Numbers Tests

This repository contains implementations of three classic algorithms for prime number detection and factorization:

- **Miller-Rabin**: a probabilistic test to verify primality.
- **Pollard Rho**: an efficient algorithm for integer factorization.
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: a classic method to generate all prime numbers up to a given limit.
